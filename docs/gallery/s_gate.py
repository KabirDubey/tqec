r"""Logical S Gate
==============

This example demonstrates a logical S gate by gate teleportation. The Y basis
measurement is done inplace, as in :footcite:t:`Gidney_inplace_access_2024`.

Construction
------------

The S gate is teleported in two steps:

- an :math:`M_{ZZ}` measurement between the target qubit and an ancilla qubit
  initialized in the :math:`|+\rangle` state,
- a Y basis measurement of the ancilla qubit, done by a Y half cube (see
  :doc:`/user_guide/terminology`).

The target qubit carries the output, and the ancilla is consumed by the Y
measurement. ``tqec`` provides the builtin function ``tqec.gallery.s_gate_teleportation``
to construct it. The ``In`` port is at the bottom of the block graph and the ``Out``
port is at the top. With a basis argument, as here, the ports are closed, so each flow
is checked by a deterministic observable rather than teleporting an arbitrary state.
The short green block is the Y half cube. The ``X`` graph has two: the ancilla's
and the ``Out`` port.

# Up to signs, the S gate maps :math:`X` to :math:`Y` and :math:`Z` to :math:`Z`.
# In this graph ``In`` is initialized in the :math:`X` basis and ``Out`` is closed
# with a Y half cube, which measures the output in the :math:`Y` basis. The
# correlation surface below shows :math:`X` at the input, at the bottom, and
# :math:`Y` at the output, at the top. It also reaches the ancilla's Y half cube,
# so that measurement outcome enters the observable.
#
# On the 3D view, the :math:`Y` part of a correlation surface is drawn as
# overlapping :math:`X` (red) and :math:`Z` (blue) surfaces. The inset in the plots
# below draws :math:`Y` in green.

# You can download the circuit for a ``d=3`` S gate from
# :download:`here <../media/gallery/s_gate/circuit.stim>`, or generate it with
# the code below, which also builds a link that opens the same circuit in Crumble.

# Simulation
# ----------

# Here we show the simulation results of the :math:`X \rightarrow Y` and
# :math:`Z \rightarrow Z` flows under the **uniform depolarizing** noise model.
